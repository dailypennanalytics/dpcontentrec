The passports typically cost about $145, the site stated<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\\n<p>The opportunity comes on the heels of last year\\'s Penn Global program that provided $10 subsidized passports to<a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2018/09/upenn-first-generation-low-income-ivy-league-study-abroad-philadelphia\" target=\"_blank\"> first-generation, low-income students</a>. The free passports became available after Penn Abroad successfully received funding from the CIEE after applying in 2017, said Jamie Nisbet, marketing and events manager for Penn Global.</p>\\n<p>“[The event was] two years in the making trying to secure funds, because while we don’t necessarily have a tradition in place, we are able to offer [these events] as we can secure funding. We think it is not a barrier, or a funding opportunity, that we get to address often,” Nisbet said.</p>\\n<p>The new passport initiative falls under CIEE\\'s Passport Caravan program, which aims to<a href=\"https://www.ciee.org/about/what-we-stand-for/access/generation-study-abroad/our-solution/passport-caravan\" target=\"_blank\"> sponsor 10,000 students nationally</a> by working with selected passport “caravan partners,\" such as Penn.&nbsp;</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"1b0884e2-f873-4976-b1fe-f18258261a2f\" data-uuid=\"1b0884e2-f873-4976-b1fe-f18258261a2f\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/5196e427-85fc-44f0-b57b-613242fff4b6.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"292\" data-height=\"375\" data-align=\"right\" />\\n<p>To secure a spot in the passport program, students must enroll by Oct. 1 and attend a “pre-check” day. They must also attend an event on Oct. 25 where they mail out the completed paperwork with the help of local passport agents.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Even though the program is now expanded beyond just FGLI students, Nisbet said Penn Abroad still encourages FGLI students to apply for a passport.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“We really want to encourage students who have been traditionally underrepresented in Study Abroad to take the opportunity, so we didn’t overly limit it to a really narrow population of students, or, we didn’t say only FGLI students, because we think that there are students that might have challenge, [who] are financial aid eligible, who are not FGLI students,” Nisbet said of those eligible for free passports.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Criteria for eligibility include being 18 years or older, being a current, degree-seeking, freshman, sophomore or junior, and being a first-time passport applicant. Students don\\'t have to enroll in a study abroad program in order to get a passport.</p>\\n<p>This initiative represents one piece of Penn Abroad’s overall attempts to reduce the barriers students face to study abroad, Nisbet said. In Fall 2018, the lowest number of students abroad in recent history was recorded, <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2018/08/study-abroad-seniors-upenn-penn-philadelphia\" target=\"_blank\">partially a result of a reported shift of On-Campus Recruitment from the spring to the fall</a>. Penn Abroad hosts other programs such as pop-up advising sessions for students to learn about the academic opportunities overseas.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>\"The passport is the necessary thing and it\\'s really the first step to being able to do that,\" she said. \"We hope that students are able to take advantage of global opportunities while they\\'re at Penn.\"&nbsp;</p>',\n",

The inaugural event took place on Sept. 21 in New York City, where students and heads of state from around the globe were brought together to develop creative, sustainable solutions.</p>\\n<p>Nguyen has been an active advocate for environmentalism long before the UN recognized his efforts. He was recognized for his efforts in 2017 by being named a <a href=\"http://thestarfish.ca/journal/2019/1/sftop25-finalist-2017-brandon-nguyen\" target=\"_blank\">Top 25 Environmentalist</a> Under 25, and in 2018, a <a href=\"https://www.corporateknights.com/channels/leadership/unafraid-meet-2018s-top-30-30-sustainability-15415345/\" target=\"_blank\">Top 30 Under 30 Sustainability Leader.</a></p>\\n<p>Nguyen said his passion for environmentalism began at an early age and stemmed from a love of Animal Planet and an interest in wildlife.</p>\\n<p>“I think I was really lucky because in grade five, I had a teacher who was super interested in teaching us about social issues and environmental issues,\" he said. \"I realized the negative implications that my own actions had on these animals that I found so fascinating.\"&nbsp;</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"2ab2c09a-8bee-4e65-83da-f73389947c62\" data-uuid=\"2ab2c09a-8bee-4e65-83da-f73389947c62\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/d395f371-f9f3-41ec-983a-6cfe9f2db8ef.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"303.28125\" data-height=\"454.69452773613\" data-align=\"right\" />\\n<p>His interests eventually turned to environmental education. In 2015, Nguyen started the Toronto Coalition of Ecosc<a href=\"https://torontoce.weebly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">hools,</a> a network of students across Toronto who are also involved in Eco Clubs at their schools.

       "   'content': '<p>When I watched “Good Will Hunting” for the first time as a high schooler, I marveled over how the professor in the movie not only helped Will cultivate a passion for mathematics but he also undertook Will’s personal strife and actively helped him overcome it. Although it’s a work of fiction, the movie sparked excitement within me as I looked forward to the day I’d receive a similar mentorship.</p>\\n<p>Penn certainly provides opportunities for students to seek mentorship, but there also seems to be a tinge of apathy from professors to provide anything further than adequate lectures for their students. In fact, this apathy may reverberate on college campuses across the country. A <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2018/12/04/too-few-undergraduates-have-a-college-mentor-three-steps-that-can-change-that/#6d5b2f412c90\" target=\"_blank\">recent survey</a> revealed that only 43% of college graduates somewhat or strongly agreed with the statement “While attending (institution), I had a mentor who encouraged me to pursue my goals and dreams.” What’s more revealing is that 19% “strongly disagreed” with the statement.</p>\\n<p>This semester, I’ve been lucky to learn from professors who truly care. On the first day of one of my classes, the professor emphasized the importance of mental health and even discussed his own experience with Counseling and Psychological Services. Another one of my professors, in the middle of an intricate lecture, unexpectedly began to encourage students about his journey to America for higher education and the fact that trying your best is enough. These small moments have contributed to a great feeling that my professors are not intimidating authoritative figures, but rather mentors who reassure that there is a bright future ahead.</p>\\n<p>More than that, when my professors shared their stories, they appeared human: they could relate to us, students. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/learning-emotion-education.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times columnist David Brooks</a> speaks about how an emotional relationship between professors and pupils can correlate with effective learning. Years earlier, he was teaching a course at Yale University when he announced that he had to cancel office hours due to personal issues that a friend was helping him with. That evening, around a dozen students emailed him, saying they were thinking of him and keeping him in their prayers. The rest of the semester was different — the class was closer, more engaged and motivated. Emotion designates value to things and dictates what to pay attention to, care about, and remember. As he states, “that one tiny whiff of vulnerability meant that I wasn’t aloof Professor Brooks, I was just another schmo trying to get through life.”</p>\\n<p>It’s unfortunate that in a university as highly regarded as Penn, encountering a professor who fosters this sort of compassionate learning environment is somewhat of a rare occurrence. In one dismal case, a friend of mine had three midterms in one day, and none of her professors were willing to understand her situation and accomodate her. In other cases, some Penn professors, especially those who conduct research, seem to lecture only so that they can get back to the better half of their research professorship.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Of course, students desiring mentorships must put in the effort to pursue them. But how are we supposed to discover our life mentors when they come across as completely disinterested? Sharing stories, empathizing with students, and vocalizing support creates a strong foundation for mentorship to grow. The same professor who underlined that trying your best is enough said something along the lines, “You guys are the next generation. I love teaching the next generation. I love you all.” In an introductory class of over a hundred students, these words were able to make an impact on each and every one of us. All Penn professors should strive to achieve this level of compassion for their students.</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"3ab72ac2-79d6-46b0-b98d-328923a61973\" data-uuid=\"3ab72ac2-79d6-46b0-b98d-328923a61973\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/2a859e6b-c23f-416d-8ec7-cdb46881ab0d.sized-1000x1000.png\" data-width=\"175\" data-height=\"218.75\" data-align=\"left\" />\\n<p><strong>CHRISTY QIU</strong> is a College sophomore from Arcadia, Calif.

Loyalties lie where they lie, and the four Quakers have stayed true to their Windy City roots.</p>\\n<p>“Chicago is just a bigger and better version of Philly,” Kulinski said.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>However, there is one redeeming quality of Philly that unanimously won over these athletes.</p>\\n<p>“Definitely the weather is a lot nicer and not as crazy compared to Chicago,\" McGregor said.</p>\\n<p>“The winter wasn’t as bad this year,\" Kulinski agreed. “It was negative 50 degrees in Chicago this past year and it was 30 degrees in Philly.\"</p>\\n<p>A typical stereotype surrounding the Midwest is the politeness that its residents have compared to other regions of the United States. There’s a different attitude when one transitions over to the East Coast after growing up in another region, and these athletes have learned to pick up on that difference.</p>\\n<p>“I think Midwest people are more likely to spend time talking to you, while the East Coast is doing a lot of hustle and bustle,” McGregor said.</p>\\n<p>All in all, the four &nbsp;Quakers have been able to come together as one strong unit for the Red and Blue this season. Planek is first on the team in total points and second in kills behind junior outside hitter Parker Jones, who is also a DP staffer.

       "   'content': \"<p>Eight years of running cross country will cover a lot of ground.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>And yet, four Penn men’s cross country athletes have taken the same path. Freshmen Sean Banko and Michael Keehan, senior Andrew Hally, and his brother Pat Hally (Class of '17) all attended Salesianum School before donning the Red and Blue.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Salesianum, located in Wilmington, Del., is an all-boys Roman Catholic school, most known for its nationally ranked soccer team. The school's running program, however, has the most wins of any program in any state. Since the beginning of the program in 1959, Salesianum cross country has failed to win the state championship just six times, which is a particularly impressive feat given the microcosm of running talent that the state of Delaware has become in the past 10 years.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Banko, Keehan, and Andrew and Pat Hally all contributed greatly to the astonishing success of their high school’s running program. During their time at Salesianum, the team won the 2014, 2016, and 2017 Delaware Cross Country State Championships. The athletes all had impressive individual feats as well.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Banko and Keehan were the first two athletes in program history to run at Nike Cross Country Nationals after qualifying at the Nike Cross Regionals. At 9:10.43, Keehan holds the school record for the 3200-meters. As a sophomore, he was also the individual Delaware state cross country champion in 2017, one of 23 individual champions from the Sallies program.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Alongside him was Pat Hally, who earned the same distinction in 2012 and 2013. For this reason, the Sallies record book is filled with the Hally name. Andrew and Pat hold the No. 2 and No. 3 all-time records for the 1600m at 4:18.03 and 4:18.09, respectively.&nbsp;Andrew, now a senior at Penn, was not always a shining running prospect. In his first two years at Salesianum, the presence of his older brother Pat weighed down his passion for the sport.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“Having my brother there definitely played into the fact that I wanted to be my own person, so I didn’t really like running as much. But I saw the work that he put in … and I had a template of someone that I could look up to,” Andrew said.</p>\\n<p>Salesianum coach Michael LoSapio saw the evolution of Andrew Hally firsthand.</p>\\n<p>“Andrew when he was a sophomore was really, really not good at running and really&nbsp;unmotivated. And his brother was a multi-time state champion,” LoSapio said. “And my assistant coach at the time wanted to talk to him and really rip into him, but I said we shouldn’t.”</p>\\n<p>The assistant coach went rogue and confronted Hally about his sub-par efforts on the team. While the confrontation is now something that Andrew laughs about, it was a defining moment of his high school running career.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“I was not using my talents to the fullest and kind of doing the bare minimum instead. It definitely was the turning point in my running career because it was me realizing that I needed to take everything more seriously,” Hally said.</p>\\n<p>Hally would go on to follow in his older brother’s footsteps and become a leader on his high school team. After the team lost the Delaware Cross Country State Championships his senior year — a first for the program in a very long time — he was instrumental in regrouping and setting the tone for a Sallies comeback.</p>\\n<p>Hally and the team would go on to win the indoor and outdoor state championships that year.</p>\\n<p>That was 2015, when Keehan and Banko were just beginning their careers as freshmen on the team. LoSapio recalled knowing the two were going to be great runners when shortly after joining the team they were able to compete with the seniors. He reminisced about a moment that would foreshadow their commitment to the same collegiate program four years later.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“I remember watching both of them go on a cool-down together, and the two of them were just chatting on a run, and I remember thinking, ‘those two are in it for life.’ And now they’re at college together,” LoSapio said.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The duo attributed a great deal of their success in high school to the impact that Andrew Hally had on Salesianum. They would ultimately follow in his footsteps, leading the team to another outdoor track victory during their senior year, just as Andrew had done when he was a senior.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>And the Hallys' presence doesn’t end there.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>When an assistant coaching spot for the Salesianum cross country team opened up in 2018, none other than Pat Hally made a return to his former home to join the coaching staff for Keehan’s and Banko’s final high school season.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“It’s pretty weird to have that cycle of our high school and Penn and then Penn back to our high school in that it was this small full cycle between the four of us,” Keehan said.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>In a truly cyclical fashion, when it was then time to leave Pat Hally, there was another Hally waiting when the two committed to Penn. Andrew picked up right where he left off, resuming his supportive role in the running careers of the incoming freshmen.</p>\\n<p>“The team already knew who we were because Andrew’s got a loud mouth. So it made it an easy transition not just athletically, but socially with the team. And a big part of that goes to Andrew for making a position for us to fit on the team,” Keehan said.</p>\\n<p>Now, in his last season at Penn, Andrew will have his last chance to chase some of the records his brother still holds. For one, Pat is the ninth fastest Penn runner of all-time in the indoor 5000m (14:27.64).&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“I was definitely aware of his records, and I got some of them and he still holds some of them. It’s a back and forth, but [it's] also grounded in support for one another, just the fun side of wanting to beat each other. You see what they do and you think, 'alright I can do a little bit better,'” Andrew said.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>When Pat and Andrew overlapped on the Quakers' cross country team in 2016, the team won the Ivy League title. Now with Pat gone, Keehan and Banko ready to contribute as freshmen, and Andrew looking to bookend another four years of running with another title, a great deal of Salesianum energy will be coursing through Penn's cross country season.</p>\",\n",

I love the competitive environment, and everyone’s so uplifting,” Raun said. “During the game, you make a mistake and instantly someone to my right or left is saying, ‘it’s ok, you got it next time,’ as well as just being surrounded by a competitive environment where I know anyone could come on the field and compete just as well as anyone who was already on the field. I think it’s important to be part of a team like that.”</p>\\n<p>As for what she has learned, Raun cites learning how to be a good teammate as the most important lesson. It’s clear that she has had a positive impact on the backfield as well.</p>\\n<p>“She gives us a calming presence back there. I think that she is able to settle us in the back a little bit. If the other team starts coming at us a little bit, she’s able to provide that calming presence,” Qu said. “She’s very quick; I think that helps a lot [in] the back. She’s able to close down space very quickly; she’s able to recover if we get countered. I think all those abilities contribute to how well she’s been playing.”</p>\\n<p>Now that the Quakers have progressed into Ivy play, Raun’s performance will be as important as ever.

       "   'content': '<p>A lot of big names come out of Marymount High School in Los Angeles. Kim Kardashian and Olivia Jade Giannulli are just two on a long and very well-known list.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Flying slightly under the radar of the school’s more noteworthy alumni are the Marymount volleyball program\\'s Taylor Fourticq and Caroline Douglas, both of whom are freshmen at Penn.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The duo attended the all-girls Catholic preparatory school together for four years before committing to play for the Red and Blue. Their volleyball team has a long history of excellence and has won three California state titles.&nbsp;During their senior year, Fourticq and Douglas almost saw the program add a fourth, as the team lost in the state final. However, they were able to lead their team to a first-place finish at the Nike Tournament of Champions.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the program is consistently at the top of the list of schools that send volleyball players to compete in the Ivy League. Of their graduating class, Fourticq and Douglas are joined by teammates playing for schools across the country, including UCLA, San Diego, and Colgate.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Marymount coach Cari Klein credits the recruiting position of the school to their brand of athletes.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“I think programs might have a lot of academic kids who play volleyball, but it’s a different story when they’re used to winning. Taylor and Caroline are used to winning championships, winning tournaments. They don’t have much losing in their background,\" Klein said. \"They expect to win.\"</p>\\n<p>And win they have. In the first two weeks of the season, the Red and Blue have racked up more wins than their season total from last year. Although the Quakers dropped their <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/09/penn-volleyball-princeton-recap-ivy-league-opener-leak-kulinski-jones\" target=\"_blank\">Ivy League opener</a> to Princeton on Friday, the team started off its season with a six-game winning streak and is looking strong ahead of the first home game this Friday.</p>\\n<p>Marymount athletes pay a high price for the success they achieve. With no real offseason, they see a full cycle of training year-round, including summer workouts on the beach and the UCLA track. At the end of their summer season, the players have what they refer to as “hell week,” which consists of two to three daily practices. When the school year resumes, the team gets in a practice before and after school on some days, in addition to traveling to competitions.</p>\\n<p>After their time at such a rigorous program, it is clear that the duo has had a fairly smooth transition to collegiate volleyball.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“Here, for instance, our weights are at 7:30 in the morning, and that literally feels like sleeping in. I still have my alarm on my phone for 4:57 in the morning called, ‘you got this,’ and I just thank God every morning that that’s never going to be set again,” Douglas said.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>While both have been playing volleyball for 10 years, at times the commitment to the sport at Marymount was far from easy. Regardless, they both looked back fondly on their senior night, an event dedicated to those who succeed through four years of the program.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“At Marymount, volleyball senior night is a huge deal. Girls literally stay in the program for four years just to have a senior night. You get these cute little teddy bears that my mom actually makes, with your jersey, and a ton of stuff that describes you,” Douglas said. “That was definitely my highlight because going through that program is really tough for four years, it’s such an accomplishment and that night is just an accumulation of everything you’ve done and everything you’ve worked for.”&nbsp;</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"e0349407-2cdb-42bb-9557-03ff27f60173\" data-uuid=\"e0349407-2cdb-42bb-9557-03ff27f60173\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/094e57f7-c806-49ca-b65c-a935e40193f7.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"372.0374755859376\" data-height=\"400.89938871752355\" data-align=\"right\" />\\n<p>Within such a demanding program, the athletes inevitably get very close. While in some sports the recruiting process is immensely stressful and can turn teammates against each other as they compete for a limited number of spots, Douglas and Fourticq had a very different experience.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“Most people aren’t competing for the same spot. Me and Dougie, because we’re different positions, weren’t competing for a specific Penn spot, which made things much less stressful,” Fourticq said.</p>\\n<p>After both attended the same sophomore summer camp at Penn, the duo had official visits on the same weekend when the Red and Blue played Princeton. Although they spent the majority of the weekend together, the coaches would separate recruits at times to give them confidential offers to join the team.</p>\\n<p>“I remember we didn’t know how to ask each other if we’d gotten the offer. I remember sitting at White Dog [Cafe] and going to the bathroom together so we could be like, ‘sooooo?’’” Douglas said.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Luckily for them, the two both got offers and committed within 48 hours of each other.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The relationships built among the Marymount athletes are lasting. When the Red and Blue were playing at the <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/09/volleyball-uc-riverside-invitational-recap-margaret-planek-carmina-raquel\" target=\"_blank\">UC Riverside Invitational</a> last week, the Marymount team, coming back from a tournament in Las Vegas, realized that Douglas and Fourticq were in their vicinity.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>While on the bus, the players tried to no avail to convince the driver to turn around so they could meet up with their teammates.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“It speaks volumes when the whole bus wants to turn and get a hug from [Fourticq and Douglas] because they know they’re in Riverside. The girls were dying to see them. They’re pretty important people to the program,” Klein said.</p>\\n<p>While they certainly embraced the athletic opportunity that Marymount had to offer, Fourticq and Douglas didn’t exactly miss out on celebrity sightings either. Kim Kardashian’s 20th reunion for Marymount fell during their time there.</p>\\n<p>“We found out that it was, in fact, Kim Kardashian’s 20th reunion one Friday night at Marymount. Our entire class of volleyball girls were all at Taylor’s house,” Douglas recalled. “We drove to Marymount that night, and I decided that I was going to be the guinea pig, that I was going to sacrifice my life. There was so much security.\"</p>\\n<p>Douglas entered the school under the guise of having lost her wallet. After wandering around for a while, she saw Kim Kardashian from a distance. The experience clearly left an impression on both of them.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“She was literally posting photos from the seat that I sat in in math,” Fourticq said.</p>\\n<p>While Olivia Jade’s presence in the class above them was more of a sensitive subject, the two rattled off a list of celebrities and famous figures that they encountered during their time at Marymount. Now-famous singer Charlotte Lawrence played volleyball with their program.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Having joined this group of notable alumni, Fourticq and Douglas are poised to contribute both on and off the court as members of this year’s new and improved Penn squad.</p>',\n",

He totaled 158 yards on 28 carries against Delaware, and one additional Brooks carry might have made all the difference for the Quakers. Against Lafayette, senior quarterback Nick Robinson handed the ball to Brooks 29 times, and the back responded with 202 rushing yards and two touchdowns.</p>\\n<p>What makes Brooks\\' performance at Lafayette even more impressive — aside from his becoming the first running back in Penn football history to eclipse the 200-yard mark three times in a career — is the time in which he did it.</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"47525595-ccb4-40ad-aebe-cdbd4a64a8b1\" data-uuid=\"47525595-ccb4-40ad-aebe-cdbd4a64a8b1\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/66afec1e-14d6-4177-a80a-c6709c04e965.sized-1000x1000.png\" data-width=\"788.40625\" data-height=\"648.84375\" data-align=\"\" />\\n<p>&nbsp;After the first quarter, the Red and Blue had amassed a mere six yards of total offense. It wasn\\'t until the fourth quarter that Brooks found the end zone for the first time. Seven plays after a short punt by Lafayette gave the Quakers starting field position at their opponent\\'s 42-yard line, Brooks took a snap in the Wildcat formation and hit paydirt from two yards out to give the Red and Blue a 21-10 lead.</p>\\n<p>With 1:43 remaining and Penn holding onto a 21-18 advantage, Brooks put the game away when he scored from 31 yards out for his second touchdown of the day.</p>\\n<p>Although he did most of his damage on the ground, Brooks has established himself as a valuable target in the Red and Blue passing game. He had three receptions against both Delaware and Lafayette, totaling 41 yards receiving.</p>\\n<p>High-volume, high-efficiency production is nothing new for Brooks, who led Penn in rushing during his sophomore and junior seasons with 840 and 898 yards, respectively. Even for the 2018 second team All-Ivy running back, though, 360 yards on the ground through two games is outlandish. He is currently averaging 6.3 yards per carry, and his mark of 180 rushing yards per game is good for the best in the Ivy League. Cornell\\'s senior running back Harold Coles is a distant second with 134 yards per game.</p>',\n",

If you spent 20 hours studying for an exam and did poorly, celebrate that you cared enough to spend 20 hours studying. If you prepared for your interview with Boston Consulting Group, and didn’t get a second round, celebrate that you tried your best.

       "   'content': '<p>You can’t win if you don’t have the ball.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Expectations were high for Penn women’s soccer as the team began Ivy League play this weekend against Harvard. However, on a hot and windy afternoon in Cambridge, Mass., the Red and Blue struggled to get anything going offensively and dropped their Ivy League opener, 1-0.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>With strong winds blowing directly toward the Penn goal in the first half, the Quakers (5-3-1, 0-1 Ivy) struggled to move the ball into the Harvard half, as the Crimson (7-2, 1-0) dominated possessions and scoring chances. Harvard went into the halftime break outshooting Penn eight shots to one, including four attempts on goal.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“The weather isn’t something that we have control of,” senior goalie Kitty Qu said. “The wind definitely affected the movement of the ball a little bit, but we really try to focus on ourselves and what we can control.”</p>\\n<p>“Your goal kicks don’t go as far, your clearances too,” coach Nicole Van Dyke said. “I think you could tell [the wind affected us]. They were in our defensive third most of the half; you don’t want the wind to affect how you play, but I think it had a significant impact.”</p>\\n<p>Despite the disparity in opportunities, Penn’s defense minimized dangerous chances, packing the box to limit Harvard to mostly long-distance shots.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“A lot of our defensive success comes from always being organized,” Qu said. “I think from a back line standpoint we tried to emphasize that a lot in this game.”</p>\\n<p>After dominating the Red and Blue for much of the first half, Harvard continued its barrage after the break, putting in four shots to the Quakers\\' one in the first 25 minutes of the second half. While a breakthrough seemed inevitable, the Penn defense continued to hold after junior defender Chase Geffert cleared a Harvard shot off the line.</p>\\n<p>Finally, in the 72nd minute, a cross on a counterattack from Harvard’s junior forward Lauren Raimondo found its way to fellow forward Gabby DelPico, who calmly slotted her shot into the bottom-left corner for her fourth goal of the season.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>After the goal, the Quakers increased their sense of urgency on offense and started to rack up scoring opportunities. During this stretch, senior forward Emily Sands put her first two shots on goal, which were two of Penn\\'s best scoring chances of the afternoon. Both shots, however, were handled by the Crimson’s senior goalie Kat Hess.</p>\\n<p>“We have been playing very well coming into the <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/09/womens-soccer-vs-temple-and-hofstra-recap-katharine-larson\" target=\"_blank\">second half,</a> so we figured that after we weathered the storm we would get some chances in the second,” Van Dyke said. “We had chances to win the game; that\\'s the reality. We probably had more high quality chances than them.”</p>\\n<p>This late flurry by the Quakers actually led to them outshooting Harvard in the second half while also racking up five corner kicks, but after the slow offensive start, this proved to be too little too late.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“Unfortunately, we just didn’t have that final push,” Van Dyke said. “We needed a little extra something … Even not playing our best we still had chances to win the game.”</p>\\n<p>Despite allowing the goal, Penn\\'s defense was the star of the show for the team, as Qu provided six saves and the back line prevented numerous other scoring chances, which kept the Quakers in the game.</p>\\n<p>“One of our biggest strengths is obviously our defense. It has been the backbone of our identity for the last couple years now,” Qu said. “[By] sticking to our defensive principles, we believe that we are always in the game no matter what happens.”</p>\\n<p>While this early loss certainly puts a dent in the team’s hopes of defending last season’s Ivy League co-championship, the Red and Blue will have plenty of time to rebound — as evidenced last season when the team tied its first Ivy game against Harvard before winning five straight League contests. The Quakers will have a chance to get right back out and avenge their defeat as they prepare to take on Cornell at home next Saturday.</p>',\n",

He talks about things that are really relevant and he doesn’t only lecture, he likes to engage us and hear our opinion on things.\"&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Throughout the semester, Booth brings historical and contemporary examples of political cartoons as well as satire from literature and plays, he said.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“From satire, you can learn how critical thinking works and how exciting it can be to be brave enough to question authority,” Booth said.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Booth has worked as a cartoonist and freelance writer for over 20 years, publishing his work under both his own name and the pen name “Mr. Fish.” He said Americans often trust satirists to explain the news more than the traditional media. &nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Booth said his lectures for each class are really just a framework for discussion and that he invites students to respond in the moment to everything he says in the lecture.</p>\\n<p>“When it comes to satire, and when you’re looking at the history of satire, a lot of it is very inflammatory,” Booth said. “It’s about starting a conversation by inciting some sort of emotional reaction. So, if I’m showing them material and I’m trying to demonstrate the importance of that kind of material, I always want to be interrupted; I always want to be challenged. I’m trying to create an environment that is completely open to lively debate.”</p>\\n<p><br></p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"b43cfb63-bb55-4837-9e3f-f679f64ea215\" data-uuid=\"b43cfb63-bb55-4837-9e3f-f679f64ea215\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/15d691d0-7a95-4be2-952d-f751a2803ccd.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"832.90625\" data-height=\"657.984375\" data-align=\"\" />\\n<p>De Almeida added that the class has shown her a new way to approach satire.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>\"People don’t normally take comedy seriously,\" De Almeida said. \"I think what we learn in this class is that humor is just as high stakes as anything else. It’s just the way that information is delivered is different which allows it to communicate things differently and sometimes communicate it even better.”</p>\\n<p>2019 College graduate Jacob Gursky, who graduated from Penn last spring with a major in Communication, said \"Sick and Satired\" was one of his favorite classes at Penn. He added that he considers Booth a mentor and remains in contact with him.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“School can be pretty insular. Sometimes it feels like, at a place like Penn, they have a very specific way they want you to think,\" Gursky said. \"I feel like it can become a space that isn’t very conducive to meaningful conversations.

Princeton scored the first two points of the game, but after a back-and-fourth sequence, the Quakers were able to bring the score to 10-10. Sophomore opposite hitter Margaret Planek pushed Penn over the edge to lead, 13-12, with her second ace of the evening, but the Tigers quickly regained supremacy. The largest lead to that point had been two points, but Princeton quickly pulled away to win the set, 20-25.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The second set continued the theme, with Penn taking a late 18-15 lead into a Princeton timeout, before the Tigers rallied to win the set 26-24. Penn\\'s success and failures in the set both came in part at the service line, where senior middle hitter Parker Jones, who is also a Daily Pennsylvanian staffer, held serve for six consecutive points during a Penn run. The Quakers finished with six service errors and five aces in the match.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The third set was less even-matched, as Princeton took an early 7-2 lead, forcing Penn into an early timeout. The Quakers stayed behind for the rest of the set, making small runs only to be stunted by the Tigers. The set ended with a score of 25-18 in favor of Princeton to complete the Tigers\\' three-set sweep.</p>\\n<p>Ultimately, Penn couldn\\'t find a way to stop Princeton’s attacking trio of senior Devon Peterkin, junior Clare Lenihan, and sophomore Elena Montgomery, who combined for 37 of the team\\'s 45 kills. Each of the three finished with double digit kills, while the Red and Blue did not have any players who reached that mark.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“We definitely had to adjust our defense and block a lot based on what Princeton was hitting,” Douglas said. “I think they’re some of the best hitters I’ve played against.”</p>\\n<p>Among those who contributed the most points for Penn were Planek and Leak.

The Red and Blue (2-1) entered the game having a 113-37 advantage over Post (0-3) in their last three contests, and this time marked no exception.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Penn took just 51 seconds to get on the board on a quarterback sneak from senior Eddie Jenkins. After forcing a Post three and out on its first possession, the Quakers scored again as Jenkins found sophomore running back Laquan McKever for a 15-yard score. On the ensuing possession, Penn forced a Post fumble, and McKever punched in another score to extend the Penn lead to 21-0.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>McKever was able to find success early on thanks to a dominant offensive line and a dual-threat quarterback, and he finished the day with three total touchdowns.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“I think our offensive line does a really great job with pretty much protecting every type of run we do. We do inside zone and outside zone, and earlier today, specifically, I think the outside was definitely working well for me,” McKever said.</p>\\n<p>In the second quarter, Penn continued to pile on points. McKever scored on a one-yard run with 12:45 left in the half, while Jenkins added two more rushing touchdowns and sophomore running back Sam Mintz found paydirt on a 10-yard run. Penn also forced a Post safety, and the Quakers entered the half with a 50-0 lead. This marked their second straight game with a <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/09/penn-sprint-football-cornell-jenkins-csfl-recap-ivy-league\" target=\"_blank\">halftime lead of at least 47 points</a>.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>McKever was impressed with the defense\\'s performance, and he pointed out that this week was not much different from last week\\'s dominant performance at Cornell.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“We have a great defense this year, and it showed up against Cornell as well. We didn’t let Cornell score until the fourth quarter, in which they only scored one touchdown. I definitely think our defense has been doing really well this year,” McKever said.</p>\\n<p>In the second half, Post was able to find more room to operate on offense. Constant back and forth between the Quakers and Eagles led to some exciting play. Overall, the teams tied in points in the second half, with one touchdown each.</p>\\n<p>Overall, the Quakers were dominant on both sides of the football, easily out gaining the Eagles both on the ground and in the air. Every facet of the game showed statistical dominance on the part of the Quakers.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>On the defensive side of the ball, Penn proved to be equally impressive. The Red and Blue held the Eagles offense to just one touchdown — late in the fourth quarter with the game well in hand — and scored points of their own with a safety. Penn also had several takeaways granting the offense short fields that helped put the game out of reach early.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“I think that our offense has a lot of confidence,\" McKever said. “We have a lot of confidence in our O-line, pass game, and in our run game. In general, as a team, we have a bunch of confidence. I definitely think that keeping this confidence up and believing that we are one of the best teams in the League is going to be what drives to be able to finish out the season and hopefully beat Navy, which would give us a bid to the championship.\"</p>\\n<p>After the commanding win, the Quakers look ahead to next weekend’s matchup, where they will take on Chestnut Hill at Franklin Field. They will try to avenge last year’s heartbreaking loss, when they nearly recovered from a 17-point deficit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>',\n",

Penn only put up six yards of offense in the entire first quarter compared to 92 from Lafayette. The Leopards marched down the field for a field goal on their opening drive, but a 3-0 lead was all they could manage through the first 15 minutes of play.</p>\\n<p>Sophomore cornerback Mohammed Diakite, a defensive power for the Quakers, left the game early with an apparent wrist injury and did not return, only adding to the Red and Blue\\'s early woes.</p>\\n<p>\"We started out slow today, but we were able to start picking it up and playing with a little bit of tempo,\" Robinson said.</p>\\n<p>After Lafayette blocked a field goal early in the second, Penn finally answered midway through the quarter with Cragun\\'s first score from Robinson, but Lafayette stormed right back to reclaim the lead at 10-7.</p>\\n<p>With time winding down in the half, the Red and Blue controlled the speed of play well and put together a textbook five-minute drive with Robinson at the helm, heading into the locker room up by a 14-10 score.</p>\\n<p>If the teams received energized talks at halftime, the tempo of play during the third quarter gave no indication. A series of slow drives on both sides saw no scoring in the third, although Penn came the closest after sophomore wide receiver Rory Starkey, Jr. reeled in a 53-yard grab from Robinson for his first career catch. However, play would break open in the final quarter.</p>\\n<p>Penn kicked off the fourth with a rushing touchdown from Brooks, but Lafayette again responded with just over two minutes on the clock and converted a Philly Special-inspired two-point conversion to cut the Quakers\\' lead to three.</p>\\n<p>Although the ensuing Leopards onside kick failed, Brooks wasn\\'t content to simply stall the game out. A pair of massive runs, including a 31-yard burst for his second score of the game, gave Penn a double-digit lead once again.</p>\\n<p>\"It was great to see him break through,\" coach Ray Priore said. \"He was kind of frustrated in the first half, we weren\\'t able to really get many yards with the run, but we made good adjustments and moved from there.\"</p>\\n<p>Another Lafayette touchdown as time expired made the score closer — to the delight of the few home fans who stayed until the end of the game — but could not close the gap as Penn secured its first win of the season.</p>\\n<p>But the Quakers have little time to sit back and rest on their laurels. This Friday the team will welcome Dartmouth to Franklin Field for the start of Ivy League play, and the Red and Blue will be out to avenge last year\\'s brutal <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2018/09/penn-football-dartmouth-recap-rushing-defense-ivy-league-loss\" target=\"_blank\">37-14 defeat</a>.</p>',\n",

While Trilogy designed the initial curriculum for the cybersecurity boot camp, Penn SAS and Engineering faculties modified the curriculum in collaboration with Trilogy. Professor James Weimer from Engineering is one of the faculty membranes contributed to the curriculum design. Professor Weimer conducts research in internet of things and medical/health technologies with a security perspective. Penn and Trilogy will also hire instructors for the program in collaboration.

The organization’s membership includes Penn Democrats, College Republicans, and the Government and Politics Association. The fund PoCo uses, known as Synergy, will not receive funding for the 2019-2020 school year, Office of Student Affairs Executive Director Katie Bonner wrote in an email to The Daily Pennsylvanian.</p>\\n<p>“The OSA provided a one time grant for the Synergy fund last year,” Bonner said. “The OSA has made no commitment to provide funding for the Synergy fund this year (2019-2020) though we are working with the group to identify new funding sources.”</p>\\n<p>Historically, PoCo has received funding from sources other than the student conduct office. PoCo President and College junior Jaywon Kim said the group had received funding from several on-campus groups prior to its financial assistance from the OSA.</p>\\n<p>“[PoCo] was actually founded through donations through Fox Leadership and Wharton Public Policy Initiative, the Annenberg School of Communication[s], and eventually the Netter Center,” said Kim. “The donations were meant to help support civic engagement and political discourse on campus.”</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"b638e281-cd44-4790-82be-39d00cc0b351\" data-uuid=\"b638e281-cd44-4790-82be-39d00cc0b351\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/c58c2eee-dbd5-4898-80c5-bb3b996a2f38.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"395.6171875\" data-height=\"296.7104404975\" data-align=\"left\" />\\n<p>When these grants stopped providing money, OSA agreed to fund the group with a one time grant for the 2018-2019 school year, Bonner said. However, Bonner said PoCo\\'s trouble with acquiring funding may hurt student political groups.</p>\\n<p>“Of course not having money in Synergy impacts PoCo’s ability to administer funds for events hosted by their member organizations,” Bonner said. “We have been partners in trying to identify new resources and provide information for departments and centers who might be a good match.”</p>\\n<p>Penn Dems leaders say they are concerned the lack of money will harm their efforts to host future events.</p>\\n<p>Penn Dems Political Director and College Junior Owen Voutsinas-Klose said for as long as he can remember, PoCo provided funding to cover indirect event expenses such as food. However, he said this lack of immediately available money could hurt attendance at future events.</p>\\n<p>“We received funding from PoCo for almost all of our events,” Voutsinas-Klose said. “Without food, we see that our attendance wanes.”</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"98541f61-4380-4ccd-b839-4c3b1aeafcc8\" data-uuid=\"98541f61-4380-4ccd-b839-4c3b1aeafcc8\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/9674f073-6b09-4eee-9313-dd4a3a0d5d15.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"788.40625\" data-height=\"525.859375\" data-align=\"\" />\\n<p>While PoCo-funded groups use funds<strong> </strong>to cover indirect expenses, Bonner said it was forbidden for the University to fund direct expenses, such as speaking fees.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“Events which are partisan in nature cannot be funded by University dollars,” she said. “Because of this, political organizations may have a difficult time finding dollars through traditional campus funding sources which are available to other student groups.”</p>\\n<p>Not every political group will be impacted by this lack of funding. Penn College Republicans Communications Director and Wharton sophomore Corey Paredes said the organization had not historically sought funding from Penn Political Coalition in the past.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“College Republicans is proud to have a strong network of financial supporters who contribute to our programs,” Paredes wrote in an email to the DP. “We anticipate no impact to our organization from POCO’s dissolution.”</p>\\n<p>For the student groups that are affected, Kim hopes to have a resolution to the issue within the next several months.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“I am hoping [this is resolved] by the end of the semester,” she said. “Obviously a really important election year is coming up.”</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>Penn graduate students have started a new organization to combat sexual harassment in academia.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The organization, called the Coalition Against Sexual Misconduct, hopes to involve students and staff across the Penn community. The coalition\\'s mission statement said it aims to “advocate for protections, policies, and a cultural shift surrounding sexual harassment and misconduct.\"</p>\\n<p>“We chose to be a coalition because we want to think about the ways that sexual harassment and misconduct happen in all of the different spaces at Penn; because it happens in undergraduate spaces very differently from graduate spaces,” said fifth-year Graduate School of Education Ph.D. student Jennifer Phuong, one of CASM\\'s student leaders.</p>\\n<p>The sexual harassment committee under Graduate Employees Together — University of Pennsylvania, the graduate student union advocacy group, inspired the formation of new coalition. The GET-UP committee, of which Phuong was a member, led a yearlong campaign for the improvement of the sexual harassment policy. Their efforts led to the establishment of a new centralized office for sexual misconduct investigation.</p>\\n<p>The idea for a coalition tackling sexual misconduct came from a panel hosted by the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly’s Sexual Harassment Reform Committee, titled <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/04/penn-sexual-harassment-in-academia-graduate-students-panel\">“#AcademiaToo</a>: The Impact of Sexual Harassment in the Academy.” This panel brought faculty members and graduate students together to discuss the impact of sexual harassment among Penn’s graduate community.&nbsp;</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"a50e2a27-af02-4286-9291-d86382c7a900\" data-uuid=\"a50e2a27-af02-4286-9291-d86382c7a900\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/717d0ded-fc24-4388-ac30-7e2f56c865c3.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"773.0625\" data-height=\"515.625\" data-align=\"\" />\\n<p>CASM is still a fledgling coalition, one that wants to inspire campus-wide, collective action. At this point, CASM leaders have met with different offices and groups at Penn who also focus on tackling issues of sexual misconduct, Phuong said. They are also speaking to staff members who can share their own experiences or wish to better serve students. As of now, they are focusing on learning about sexual harassment and its effects across campus, so that they can better address these issues.</p>\\n<p>“Within the graduate level, we’ve been having trouble finding groups that are doing explicitly this work. And so, that’s where we kind of see ourselves situated,” Phuong said.</p>\\n<p>The coalition has hosted events referred to as reading groups, where members read news articles and watch videos about sexual harassment issues at universities and then discuss them, Phuong said. They also wrote the sexual misconduct section of this year’s “disorientation guide” for graduate students.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>One major issue the coalition wants to tackle is the lack of a united graduate student movement against sexual misconduct. This generally arises because Penn’s 12 graduate schools run very independently of each other, and each school has its own system for dealing with issues of sexual misconduct.</p>\\n<p>“That’s really what allows a culture of sexual misconduct and sexual harassment to flourish – the fact that no one outside of the specific department or institution or school that it’s happening in is aware of it,” said CASM member and second-year political science Ph.D. student Miranda Sklaroff.&nbsp;</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"ce7eda73-4efd-45c3-961a-384b16635547\" data-uuid=\"ce7eda73-4efd-45c3-961a-384b16635547\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/3815558b-2673-4f2b-8748-50ccc7758b4e.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"773.0625\" data-height=\"515.625\" data-align=\"\" />\\n<p>“We really want to start thinking about what sexual harassment becomes in all of these different departments and how does it get silenced and hidden because people don’t have chances to talk to each other,” Phuong said. “Each school has its own system that’s run really differently, and so that just makes it easier for Penn to mask what’s happening in those spaces.”</p>\\n<p>Members of CASM gave feedback to administration in <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/03/sexual-misconduct-reporting-office-penn-policy-graduate-students\" target=\"_blank\">Jan. 2019 </a>in response to the proposed policy establishing a centralized sexual misconduct reporting office. The coalition annotated the policy together and sent comments to the administration, but felt as if none of their feedback taken into consideration.</p>\\n<p>“Since Penn is so siloed, even when we talk to administrators who might be really high up, when we ask them questions, like \\'who was involved in making the decisions about the sexual misconduct policy; who was in the room?\\' high-level administrators can’t answer that question,” Phuong said.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>CASM held their first meeting on Sept. 12. The discussion involved inherent power dynamics at the graduate student level, especially between advisors and students. Four administrators also attended the meeting, including Chief Wellness Officer Benoit Dube, according to an email from VPUL chief communications officer Monica Yant-Kinney.</p>\\n<p>Phuong said, however, it was clear from the meeting that the administrators and the group had different perspectives on how to effect change on campus.&nbsp;</p>',\n",

I was blessed to have a great high school career, with great teammates, so after a season or two, I started thinking it was a possibility [to play in college].”</p>\\n<p>As a player, Becker did not have a usual path. He was all set to join the Red and Blue right after high school, but he had to postpone his time in Philadelphia due to financial issues, enrolling at Florida State instead. After one year, however, Becker was finally able to transfer to Penn, where he played 25 games and was on two Ivy League title-winning teams.</p>\\n<p>Ironically, Becker believes his most important season as a Quaker was the one when he was injured — despite finding great success on the field.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“When I got hurt, I was also able to build bonds with the coaches. I was constantly helping out. In practice I was with [coach Ray] Priore, and then on game days, I was with the offensive staff,” Becker said, “I was able to figure out the impact I could have on my teammates and the other quarterbacks, even though we were competing. I could talk to them and tell them what we were seeing from upstairs. It was a passion for me, and I knew I wanted to get in it right away.”</p>\\n<p>His coaching abilities were also very noticeable to the rest of the team.</p>\\n<p>“He was a very intelligent quarterback, and he understood the game a little different than anybody else,” Priore said, “He had those instincts as a player that would make great attributes as a coach. He would come in everyday with the same focus and passion.\"</p>\\n<p>Following his graduation from Wharton in 2013, Becker received an offer to rejoin the Seminoles and headed back to Florida State as a graduate assistant coach. During his three years there, Florida State went 33-7 and won the 2016 Orange Bowl. In 2017, Becker decided to return to Philadelphia, working as an Assistant Director of Operations for the Quakers.</p>\\n<p>Last season, he moved once again and accepted the opportunity to work as a tight ends coach for East Tennessee State.</p>\\n<p>“Even though my heart was here at Penn, it was an amazing opportunity,” Becker said, “And I was always told that if you know how to coach quarterbacks and the offensive line, you can figure the rest out. I teach the tight ends how to block and run routes like receivers, so I use my past knowledge to explain it to them what the quarterback sees.\"</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"f6c0d1ea-3875-4632-94da-7f362dba138b\" data-uuid=\"f6c0d1ea-3875-4632-94da-7f362dba138b\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/81de65dd-198e-4b22-9bca-3fd99ee2d687.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"788.40002441406\" data-height=\"525.86248779297\" data-align=\"\" />\\n<p>However, his time with the Buccaneers ended quickly. Viewing Penn as a second home, Becker couldn’t pass up the chance to return.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“I had a phenomenal time at East Tennessee State, but there’s Red and Blue in my blood,” Becker said, “It’s hard for me to think of a better place to be, especially with the amazing coaching staff and my wife being here. It was a no-brainer to come back.”</p>\\n<p>Becker’s wife also could not stay away from the Red and Blue after graduating. Since 2015, Kirsten Strausbaugh has served as an assistant coach for Penn gymnastics and has played a key role in Becker’s coaching success.</p>\\n<p>“She worked in Tallahassee for a year, but one of her lifelong goals was to come back and coach gymnastics. It was hard being away from her, but that’s her passion and I admire her a lot for that,” Becker said. “I learn schemes and tactics from other coaches, but I learned how to talk to people and get the best out of an athlete from my wife. She’s easily one of the best coaches I’ve ever seen.”</p>\\n<p>His passion for the Quakers and his previous experience as a player have also helped him connect to current players as well.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“It means something to have alumni on staff because I was in their shoes a few years ago,” Becker said. “I know the goods and bads that come with Penn, and we can help the players through the hard times. We understand the stress the kids can be under and how to back off or push harder when they need.”</p>\\n<p>As far as expectations go, Becker doesn\\'t worry about the number of wins and losses. For him, it’s all about encouraging the players to give their best on the field.</p>\\n<p>“Wins start piling up as soon as you start understanding your assignments and doing your work to the best of your ability,” Becker said, “If you play the Philadelphia Eagles, for example, and you play the best game of your life, you still might lose but you can still be proud of what you did. That’s what really matters to me.”</p>\\n<p>With nine games left in the season, the Quakers still have a long way to go if they want to bring home the conference title. Nonetheless, Becker knows what it takes to win a championship — and most importantly, he has a genuine passion for the Red and Blue.</p>',\n",

We went up, and then we were down. We fought back and really played all four quarters,” coach Ray Priore said.</p>\\n<p>While the Red and Blue (0-1) are only one game into the new season, the Leopards (0-4) already have four games under their belt. And although Lafayette may be winless so far, the Leopards still have plenty of&nbsp;talent.</p>\\n<p>Leading the way for Lafayette is quarterback Keegan Shoemaker. The freshman standout has put up big numbers to start off the season, ranking first in the Patriot League in completion percentage (63%), completions per game (20),&nbsp;passing efficiency (136.1), passing yards (1,024), passing yards per game (256.0), passing yards per completion (13), and total offense (283.3). Senior wide receiver Nick Pearson has been Shoemaker’s top target, averaging over 70 receiving yards per game and leading the team in touchdown receptions.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“We just have to pressure Shoemaker all game long. We will pass rush like we do in every game, but we are also going to try and mix up the looks — zone covers, man covers,” senior defensive lineman Taheeb Sonekan said.</p>\\n<p>While the Leopards have excelled passing the ball with Shoemaker, they have not found the same success on the ground. Lafayette's running game is lead by freshman running back John Gay, but the freshman is averaging only 30.3 yards per game and 3.9 yards per attempt. Second on the team in rushing yards is Shoemaker, who is averaging only 24.8 yards per game and 2.1 yards per attempt.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Inconsistency has been the main issue for Lafayette. Offensively, the Leopards have had games with almost 600 yards of offensive production; they have also had games with less than 250. They have had games with only one turnover and games with four turnovers. As a result, on their off days, the Leopards have found themselves losing by up to 29 points.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>On the other hand, the Quakers are highlighted by their running attack. In the loss to Delaware, the Red and Blue outgained the Blue Hens offensively by over 100 yards, much of that attributed to the fact that Penn amassed 269 yards on the ground to Delaware's 100. Led by senior running back, Karekin Brooks–who just became the 11th Quaker of all time to reach 2,000 career rushing yards–the Red and Blue should be able to find the same success running the ball against a Lafayette defense that is allowing almost 200 rushing yards per game.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“A lot of things work in the run game because [Brooks and senior quarterback Nick Robinson] are so good. Having Brooks behind you, you know he is gonna make a cut that’s going to make you look good even if you mess up,” senior offensive lineman Ace Escobedo said.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>In the passing game, the Quakers have a lot to look forward to in senior quarterback Nick Robinson. Against Delaware, he went 18-for-27 for 193 yards and three touchdowns. Robinson was able to find sophomore wide receiver Ryan Cragun on eight passes for 145 yards in Cragun's first varsity game. The duo will look to find the same success on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>It will be homecoming weekend for Lafayette when the Quakers come in town on Saturday, and both teams will look to come away with their first win of the season.&nbsp;</p>\",\n",

The Crimson (6-2) have scored 12 goals and conceded just two in their last three contests, and while the Red and Blue (5-2-1) are coming off a weekend during which they split games with Hofstra and Temple, coach Nicole Van Dyke thinks that the team is playing better than some of its results would suggest.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“Despite the fact that we didn’t get a result against Hofstra, we were the better team on the day, and they’re a top-50 team,” Van Dyke said. “This team relies heavily on getting better throughout the week and then implementing that on the weekend.”</p>\\n<p>With regard to the Harvard matchup, Van Dyke admitted that teams do tend to rely on more experienced players as the League season begins, but she also said that strong minutes from freshmen like defender Peyton Raun and midfielder Sara Readinger have made for lots of healthy competition within the squad.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Above all, Van Dyke sees the game as an opportunity for Penn to build on some of its momentum as it gets into its conference schedule.</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"bcebd00d-6f28-4f9f-9ff8-42cb2acb717f\" data-uuid=\"bcebd00d-6f28-4f9f-9ff8-42cb2acb717f\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/a8e2d55f-c3b9-42be-b7f5-e213fc5a97a9.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"788.40002441406\" data-height=\"525.86248779297\" data-align=\"\" />\\n<p><strong>How will men’s soccer handle the pressures of a harsh West Virginia environment?</strong></p>\\n<p>After suffering their first home loss of the season on Tuesday against Lehigh, the Quakers will look to rebound when they head to Morgantown, W. Va. for a Saturday evening matchup with West Virginia. The Mountaineers (5-2-1) are coming off of a 4-1 win at Ohio State, and they’ve already secured a 5-2 win over No. 15 Coastal Carolina.</p>\\n<p>“West Virginia is a good program and playing out there is not an easy place to go and play, but we’re excited about the opportunity to go play again against another really good team,” coach Brian Gill said. “We’ll have to regroup from [Lehigh] and hopefully make some changes that will give us a good opportunity to come back from West Virginia with a good result.”</p>\\n<p>Led by junior midfielder Joey Bhangdia and his four goals on the year, the Red and Blue (3-2-1) have thus far had much better luck finding the net than during the 2018 season, and they hope that their increased offensive output can be maintained in a challenging environment.&nbsp;</p>',\n",

Perfection is exhausting, so there’s nothing more enjoyable than to get a little messy on the weekend, to surrender control to a shot of vodka or ten. Moderation is not in the vocabulary of the typical Penn student, who in the early morning hours inevitably finds themself not in bed but in a club downtown or in Van Pelt Library. The Penn lifestyle of lurching between these extremes is a wonderfully efficient way of squeezing every last drop of dopamine from the brain. These behaviors, which should theoretically help one feel better, only serve to exacerbate their stress and misery.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>While going out is supposed to allow for a release, at Penn, it is also a way of enhancing social standing. Especially during the formal rush period in the springtime, fraternities spend an exorbitant amount of funds on axe-throwing retreats, dinners at Brazilian steakhouses, and cruises to New York City. Even during the rest of the year, Penn students pride themselves on the number of downtowns that they can cram into their Google calendar and the number of the days of the week that they can spend drinking or smoking at some bar or club. Penn students are said to do a mental calculus, where they seek to optimize their GPA, minimize their time spent studying, and maximize the time spent partying and otherwise increasing clout. What these calculations don’t take into account is sleep, rest, and other activities that are necessary to lead a healthy and happy lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Penn’s social scene is in desperate need of an overhaul. Although frat parties, downtowns, and all the rest have the capacity to be enjoyable activities, Penn’s culture has a way of enticing people to drink beyond their limit and of making everything into a competition of social capital. Although it is not the most appealing option, the best solution to navigating this toxic culture is to limit your exposure to it. Philadelphia is a rich and vibrant city with countless alternatives to choose from, from shows to cultural sites. Moreover, it is far easier to genuinely get acquainted with Penn’s accomplished student population while your BAC is below .05. While there is nothing wrong with going clubbing or rolling frats every now and then, Penn students do it to an excessive degree. For the sake of their physical and mental well-being, Penn students need to exercise moderation more and go out less.</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"23b64716-7d9f-4c78-af7b-a4c6e9f99b10\" data-uuid=\"23b64716-7d9f-4c78-af7b-a4c6e9f99b10\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/511386ff-0ea7-43e1-b0d7-849d699e347f.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"175\" data-height=\"218.75\" data-align=\"left\" />\\n<p><strong>JAMES MORRISON</strong> is a College sophomore from Pipersville, P.A. studying English.

At its best, going out lets students indulge in destructive behaviors that are ultimately dangerous for the mind and body.

For me and many others, rent, food, and textbooks matter more than fashion. I have some nice things, many hand-me-downs, thrifted corduroys pants that I will continue to wear with a passion, and nothing even close to designer unless Free People counts. Penn fashion is highly polarizing, and instead of judging someone for what they choose to put on their body, we should practice accepting alternate styles. ]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle=\"ParagraphStyle/p\"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/[No character style]\"><Content><![CDATA[Not everyone can afford those Louis Vuitton lock necklaces. Not everyone wants to wear Common Projects sneakers. Beyond the question of personal taste is the issue of accessibility. Not everyone has access to the designer trends that float around Penn’s campus on a monthly basis. Every October when the Burberry scarves and Moncler jackets come out, I rifle through my drawer for the gray scarf my mother knit for me four years ago. Obviously the two don’t have the same material or sentimental value, and it’s unproductive to place them on hierarchical scale based on frivolous stipulations of whether money or memories are more important. What’s important is what makes people feel good about themselves. But at a school that prioritizes Supreme t-shirts over the ones thrifted from Second Mile, getting dressed in the morning can seem like a much bigger issue than it is. If the judgement associated with personal style were turned into air of acceptance, getting dressed in the morning would be a much happier experience. ]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle=\"ParagraphStyle/p\"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/[No character style]\"><Content><![CDATA[The cliqueishness that accompanies the different bubbles of Penn students is only amplified by clothing choices. Having gone to an arts high school with a strict dress code, I have lived through being stripped of individual choice when it comes to how you express yourself through clothing. I’m sure many of you can relate. As full-fledged adults in a world where dress codes no longer exist, I figured I’d be done with the judgement associated with how I clothe my body when I came to Penn. But the conversation has just shifted from a teacher telling me my “shorts are too short” to peers remarking that my shoes “are knock-offs.” My question is, so what if my shoes are knock-offs? It’s my feet that have to wear them.]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle=\"ParagraphStyle/p\"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/[No character style]\"><Content><![CDATA[Penn fashion has been polarizing to me since my first year, and it seems to only be getting more obvious. As people come into their own, clothing is an exciting way of making yourself feel like your truest self. Sometimes this includes designer pieces and sometimes this includes wearing your best friend’s pants because men’s pants fit you better. Personal expression is for the benefit of the person doing it, not to create opportunities for judgement from onlookers. ]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle=\"ParagraphStyle/p\"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/[No character style]\"><Content><![CDATA[Not everyone has the same taste in clothing, let alone the same accessibility. Some people don’t give a damn what they put on their body as long as they’re kept warm. All of these are equally valid ways of moving through the world, so why do Penn students find it so necessary to lay judgement? You’re always going to need to clothe yourselves in public, and when people are shamed or blamed for not being with the times, the necessary act of getting dressed in the morning can become stressful. I like corduroy pants and I’m going to keep wearing them. If you don’t, then don’t wear them. It’s as simple as that. ]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle=\"ParagraphStyle/p\"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/i\"><Content><![CDATA[SOPHIA DUROSE]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/[No character style]\"><Content><![CDATA[ ]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/i\"><Content><![CDATA[is a College junior from Orlando, Fla. studying English.

It was tasked with constructing a long-term plan to improve water management and sustainability in the region, which is found where the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers meet. The center recently completed the first stage of this analysis.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The Water Center published an initial <a href=\"https://watercenter.sas.upenn.edu/accelerating-transformational-change-in-pittsburghs-three-rivers/#fn-5505-1\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on Pittsburgh that identified the challenges the area faces, including industrial and agricultural pollutants, crumbling infrastructure, floods, poorly coordinated land use, and sewer overflow. The report is based on interviews with over 50 area organizations, as well as research into the literature of water management.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The Water Center concluded that a “systematic and integrated approach” is needed to resolve the water system challenges.

       "   'content': '<p>I remember the first time that I doubted&nbsp;God’s existence. I was twelve, staring benignly down at a Bible, when it hit me that I wasn’t sure I believed any of what I was reading. I obsessed; I would push it out of my head, only to have doubts come back at the worst possible times. I felt guilty. I didn\\'t tell anyone. And although this process started well before I came to Penn, college is where many people experience something similar for the first time.</p>\\n<p>For some, coming to Penn can be an opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2018/06/sophia-durose-judaism-ivy-league-hillel-religion-community-christian-upenn-philadelphia\" target=\"_blank\">reconnect with a faith</a> or explore a new one. But for many of us, coming to college can completely upend the worldview we walked in with. Maybe you are leaving a family, community, or country where practicing one religion was compulsory, and you realize you’re not sure you want to go to services or do your prayers when it’s your <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/02/christianity-boston-pastors-ivy-league-church-joel-lee-upenn-philadelphia\" target=\"_blank\">choice for the first time</a>. Maybe during a late night talk, one of your friends asks difficult questions about the logic of what you believe, and you feel defensive and attacked before you ultimately realize they’re right: you don’t have answers.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Doubting your faith can be one of the most disorienting experiences you can go through. But it’s a very important experience. If the process of questioning leads you to stop believing in what you once did, that is genuinely alright. And college is an excellent opportunity to go through the process of challenging your religious beliefs.</p>\\n<p>Religious practice is an important part of many people’s lives, and I believe wholeheartedly in its benefits. At its best in any form, it can foster community, provide solace in times of stress, encourage self-betterment and altruism, and offer a framework for navigating key existential questions. But our generation is the <a href=\"https://psmag.com/ideas/gen-z-is-the-least-religious-generation-heres-why-that-could-be-a-good-thing\" target=\"_blank\">least religious generation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/12/millennials-increasingly-are-driving-growth-of-nones/\" target=\"_blank\">driving up</a> the <a href=\"https://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/\" target=\"_blank\">increasing number of Americans</a> who don’t identify with any religion. Some have taken this doubt as a symptom of a larger defect in our generation, but in my own experience, the problem has been with rigid religious institutions. It makes perfect sense that living in an increasingly diverse, connected world would make young people prone to question the truth and absoluteness of any perspective. I don’t think faith communities have done enough to respond to these questions.</p>\\n<p>In the church that I grew up in, the worst thing you could do was leave. The flannel-clad pastors and guitar-playing worship leaders at my Evangelical church were effusive about bringing new converts to Jesus, but spoke in hushed tones about young people “falling away” from the church.

       "   'content': '<p>The numbers are in — Penn student voting saw <a href=\"https://www.pennvotes.org/penn-voting-data/\" target=\"_blank\">unprecedented growth in 2018</a>, and the margins weren’t even close.</p>\\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://idhe.tufts.edu/2018data\" target=\"_blank\">new report by the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement</a> (NSLVE), conducted by the <a href=\"https://idhe.tufts.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for Democracy &amp; Higher Education</a> (IDHE) at Tufts University’s <a href=\"https://tischcollege.tufts.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Tisch College of Civic Life</a>, Penn student turnout for registered students surged from 24.8% in 2014 to 53.5% in 2018 — a 28.7 point boost that demonstrates Penn’s leadership as the Civic Ivy and validates our designation as the only <a href=\"http://www.pennvotes.org/voter-friendly-campus/\" target=\"_blank\">Voter-Friendly Campus in the Ivy League</a>.</p>\\n<p>Together, we undoubtedly made history; yet, the need and opportunity for improvement remains. With the November 5th elections quickly approaching, Penn must continue to be a leader in reducing persistent disparities by empowering young, underrepresented voices through voting and civic engagement — and it starts now, with registration.</p>\\n<p>By all accounts, <a href=\"https://www.pennvotes.org/penn-voting-data/\" target=\"_blank\">Penn’s surge outpaced</a> the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/why-college-students-could-draw-new-attention-in-2020-their-turnout-doubled-for-the-midterms-study-finds/2019/09/18/7a32ca42-d981-11e9-a688-303693fb4b0b_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">national average</a> in a historic year when college students began to close the enduring turnout gaps that have plagued our democracy. In 2014, the average voting rate of all US voters was 17.5% higher than the rate for college students. In 2018, that disparity shrank to 10%, as students nationwide turned out at a rate of 40.8%. For perspective, 18-to-29 year olds have <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/10/new-poll-suggests-historic-midterm-youth-turnout/574141/\" target=\"_blank\">only surpassed 20% twice</a>, and never reached 40%, in the 48 years since the <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xxvi\" target=\"_blank\">26th Amendment</a> granted most college students the right to vote.</p>\\n<p>In fact, 2018 was not just a watershed for student voter turnout, it was one of the most diverse in an election cycle that saw <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/31/us/politics/midterm-election-candidates-diversity.html\" target=\"_blank\">the most diverse field of candidates ever</a>. As the <a href=\"https://idhe.tufts.edu/2018-nslve-data-portal\" target=\"_blank\">NSLVE data for 2018</a> shows, women continued voting at higher rates than men, while black women remained more reliable voters than any other group at 43% and turnout for Asian and Latinx women tripled. Every group saw double-digit growth in voter turnout, and we became the <a href=\"https://iop.harvard.edu/about/newsletter-press-release/memo-historic-turnout-and-performance-young-voters\" target=\"_blank\">difference</a> in contended races throughout the country.</p>\\n<p>So much for millennial voices not counting.</p>\\n<p>Not only did we become part of history in 2018; Penn did it twice. In May, Penn students again voted in record numbers during Philadelphia’s local primary, despite <a href=\"http://www.pennvotes.org/policy-briefs/\" target=\"_blank\">numerous systematic barriers</a> designed to disenfranchise students throughout Pennsylvania. In fact, led by <a href=\"https://www.pennvotes.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Penn Leads The Vote</a>’s implementation of Penn’s first-ever absentee ballot campaign for a local primary election, approximately 100 absentee ballots were recorded — the previous record was 2.</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, truly equal representation remains distant, and in the midst of historic numbers, we cannot ignore the disparities that persist.</p>\\n<p>Student voting rates remain 10 percentage points behind the national average, while every racial minority group continues to lag behind their white counterparts, with the exception of black women. Voting rates at Penn continue to trend predictably alongside academic field of study, with some fields like engineering and business voting at approximately half the rate of fields like education. Both turnout and registration continue to be challenges for students, particularly when state laws aim to strip people of their right to vote with closed primaries, late voting dates, no early voting, and an absentee ballot rejection rate <a href=\"https://digital.olivesoftware.com/Olive/ODN/PhiladelphiaInquirer/shared/ShowArticle.aspx?doc=PHQP%2F2019%2F07%2F26&amp;entity=Ar01505&amp;sk=2E6B630E&amp;mode=text#=undefined\" target=\"_blank\">11 times higher than the national average</a>.</p>\\n<p>Young voters like us cannot continue to be underrepresented in our nation’s electorate. In 2018 and 2019, we showed the country the power of our voices; now it’s time to build on our success.

Luckily for Penn, both teams were able to boost themselves into top-ten positions in particularly stacked competitions, showing the capacity to improve team placement in a relatively quick turnaround period.</p>\\n<p>In Boston, Penn's runners were able to beat out many of the 21 participating teams, which included groups from the ACC and SEC along with fellow Ivy League competitor Brown.

       "   'content': '<p>In a weekend that brought mixed results, one thing was clear: Coach Nicole Van Dyke may need to find a full-time job as a halftime motivational speaker.</p>\\n<p>Coming into the weekend, Penn women\\'s soccer was riding high. The Quakers had won their previous three matches, were unbeaten in their previous five, and hadn’t given up a goal since Sept. 6. All three of those streaks ended on Friday against Hofstra, who beat the Red and Blue, 2-1. However, Penn bounced back two days later with a 2-1 win of its own against Temple.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>On Friday, the Red and Blue (5-2-1) took on Hofstra (6-3). They went down early, giving up a goal in the 10th minute before allowing another in the 23rd.</p>\\n<p>Down 2-0 at halftime, Penn stepped up its defensive intensity. The team allowed just five second half shots after allowing 11 in the first. Junior defender Katharine Larson dribbled into the box, got fouled, and converted the ensuing penalty kick for her first career goal. However, the Quakers’ comeback effort was ultimately stymied.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>On Sunday, the Red and Blue matched up against Philadelphia rival Temple (2-4-3). In the 34th minute, Temple forward Emma Wilkins converted a goal off a rebound. Again, the Quakers found themselves playing from behind.</p>\\n<p>In the first few minutes of the second half, Penn ramped up its aggressiveness. In their first time touching the ball in the final 45 minutes, the Red and Blue earned a corner, and the chances didn’t stop there. Within six minutes, they were on the board, as Larson scored her second goal of both the weekend and her career.</p>\\n<p>“I’ve been really fortunate to play with a bunch of players who have put me in good positions,” Larson said. \"I’ve been playing a lot better with [forward Emily] Sands and [midfielder Allie] Schachter, so it’s been them setting me up.</p>\\n<p>Sands and Schachter were both credited with assists on Larson’s goal.</p>\\n<p>Just two minutes later, senior forward Emma Loving got in on the fun. Coming down the right wing, she cut the ball to her left foot, leaving a defender in her wake. She fired a shot from just inside the box, and it curved its way into the bottom-left corner of the net.</p>\\n<p>“[Allie] Schachter saw a window open and found the pass that we’d been looking for for a while. I drove in, saw that [the defender] was letting me take it onto my left, saw the shot, and took it,” Loving said.</p>\\n<img class=\"media-embed\" data-embedded-media=\"676df5a6-9bc6-4a63-91e8-a07e89e84da7\" data-uuid=\"676df5a6-9bc6-4a63-91e8-a07e89e84da7\" data-link-to=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/snwceomedia/dpn/2876b6fc-de37-4352-97d1-5651f3113519.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" data-width=\"893.859375\" data-height=\"596.203125\" data-align=\"\" />\\n<p>In the first halves of the two games, the Quakers were outscored by a combined three goals. In the second halves, though, they outscored Hofstra and Temple by three. They attacked with more purpose, created more chances in the final third rather than relying on long balls, and were more organized.</p>\\n<p>“I wish I could [attribute] it to some magical words of wisdom, but I think [the players] do a great job at halftime of figuring out what we need,” Van Dyke said. “The reality is, I think it took some fresh legs to get us into the game tonight.”</p>\\n<p>After the two games, there is plenty for Penn to build on. Hofstra, which made it to the second round of the NCAA Tournament last year, was a tough opponent and a top-50 team in the country, and the Quakers had the chances necessary to tie them. In the second half of the Temple game, Penn was creating chance after chance.</p>\\n<p>Ancient Eight play begins next Saturday at Harvard, and Penn will need to put its best foot forward to find success. If the Red and Blue play like they did in these second halves, the Ivy League will need to watch out.</p>',\n",

After narrowly winning the first set, the Quakers went back and forth with the Redhawks (7-5) in the next four frames, ultimately&nbsp;taking the fifth set to win the match. Sophomore captain Margaret Planek posted three aces and 13 kills, second only to junior captain and Daily Pennsylvanian staffer Parker Jones, who led both teams with 16 kills.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Planek is off to a solid start to her second season with the Red and Blue. It took her just six games this year to surpass her season total of 53 kills in 25 games in 2018. She’s currently sitting at a season total of 103.5 points, which at an average of 3.34 per set puts her at sixth overall in the Ivy League.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Later on Friday, Penn had a meeting with UC Riverside. The Highlanders (4-6) took the first set before the Red and Blue bounced back, winning the next three sets consecutively. Freshman outside hitter Autumn Leak led the Quakers with 11 kills, while Planek had a strong showing on defense, posting four blocks. While the Red and Blue consistently defended their side of the court, they were forced to step up their offensive attack.</p>\\n<p>“On the West Coast, we saw more solid defense,\" Leak said. \"In the [previous two tournaments], it has been easier to get through blocks. This weekend, we struggled a little bit trying to put the ball on the floor, so we had to work extra hard to really find those open spaces and put the ball down.\"</p>\\n<p>While attacking on offense was a challenge throughout the weekend, Penn\\'s defense — and particularly sophomore Carmina Raquel — performed well. Raquel, a defensive specialist, currently leads the Ivy League in digs, with 162 in nine games. Additionally, this weekend marked her second consecutive all-tournament honor.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>On Saturday afternoon, Penn capped off its weekend against Cal State Fullerton. After the Quakers picked up the first two sets, the Titans (7-3) fought back to take the next couple, capitalizing on errors by the Red and Blue. Penn put up a fight in the fifth set but ultimately lost, 15-12, ending its six-game win streak.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>After facing some tough competition in Riverside, a point of emphasis for the Quakers was efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>“The whole theme of this weekend was holding ourselves to a higher standard and being more accountable to each other. Also playing with a sense of urgency,” Leak said. “We’ve had a lot of five-set matches and four-set matches, but in the future, our goal is to really make sure that we beat teams in three.”</p>\\n<p>The Quakers will look to build off of another multi-win weekend as they open up Ivy League play at Princeton (4-5) on Friday.&nbsp;</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>Two years after it first petitioned to become a union, the graduate student group Graduate Employees Together – University of Pennsylvania will no longer be allowed to unionize after an anticipated National Labor Relations Board decision.</p>\\n<p>On Friday, the National Labor Relations Board <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/business/economy/grad-students-labor.html\" target=\"_blank\">proposed legislation </a>that would overturn their 2016 ruling that gave graduate student employees at private universities the federal right to unionize. The NLRB justified its proposal by stating that graduate students are “primarily students with a primarily educational, not economic, relationship with their university,\" according to the <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/09/23/2019-20510/jurisdiction-nonemployee-status-of-university-and-college-students-working-in-connection-with-their\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Register</a>.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>For GET-UP members, the predicted ruling is a set-back for their hopes for unionization. However, they remain hopeful that their efforts to advocate for workplace issues will continue, and Friday\\'s proposed ruling will be overturned in the future.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>GET-UP has organized around a number of workplace issues, such as lobbying for increased funding and guaranteed health insurance, even though it has not been a formal union, according to a statement on<a href=\"http://getupgrads.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> GET-UP\\'s website</a>. In the 2017-2018 school year, the group successfully improved the Graduate School of Education\\'s sexual harassment policies, with efforts like implementing yearly training for faculty and staff on preventing sexual harassment and violence.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>\"We’re still going to continue to organize around issues that affect us as workers,\" said fifth-year Graduate School of Education Ph.D. student Jennifer Phuong, who has been a GET-UP member for several years. \"Even if that doesn’t mean an active campaign to establish a union through legal systems, it still means we’re going to try to advocate for ourselves as graduate workers and different types of graduate workers across Penn.\"</p>\\n<p>GET-UP leaders wrote in a statement to their members that the conservative board, with members appointed by President Donald Trump, will officialize the proposed legislation outlawing graduate student unions on Sept. 23.</p>\\n<p>\"On Monday, September 23rd the National Labor Relations Board (N.L.R.B.) will rule that graduate students are not workers and therefore are ineligible to form a union,\" read the email to GET-UP members, dated Sept. 21. \"We refuse to let this stymie our efforts to build graduate student worker power at Penn for the simple reason that N.L.R.B. Appointees, like the Presidents who appoint them, do not last forever.\"</p>\\n<p>The new NLRB ruling could give universities the upper hand in union negotiations and could reduce the incentive for universities to bargain with union groups, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/business/economy/grad-students-labor.html\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times reported</a>.

Dr. Minkowitz outlined the safety debate around vaccinations and its relation to Jewish law. Rabbi Levi Haskelevich, Penn’s campus rabbi since 2000, linked the inspiration for this week’s discussion to a Penn student recently asking him why Orthodox Jews do not vaccinate their children.

He brought up the biblical obligation to guard one’s health, which traditionally means passively avoiding harm but can also mean proactive measures such as the case of fleeing a city which is about to be exposed to an epidemic. He concluded that Jewish law does not obligate followers to vaccinate due to the relatively low risk of contracting a disease and the slight risk involved in vaccination. However he added that followers may vaccinate and are encouraged to do so for the good of society. ]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle=\"ParagraphStyle/p\"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/[No character style]\"><Content><![CDATA[Dr. Minkowitz is the Assistant Professor of Radiology at Weill Cornell Medicine and an Assistant Attending Radiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.

While the presentation featured remarks by students of the Latinx Coalition Board, Rev. William Gipson, a letter from President Amy Gutmann, and keynote speakers, such as Gilbert Casellas Law ‘77 and Wendy De La Rosa Wharton ‘11, among others, Director of La Casa Latina, Johnny Irizarry, announced his retirement this coming April. ]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle=\"ParagraphStyle/p\"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/[No character style]\"><Content><![CDATA[Johnny Irizarry contributed much to La Casa Latina and deep sadness was felt in the crowd as he announced that he would be leaving. La Casa Latina has been a home-base for almost every student involved. Diego Caceres, a sophomore in the College and a leader in the Latinx Coalition, remarked that La Casa Latina provides students with an inclusive opportunity to display culture diversity on campus through fun events celebrating different music and food, but also garners emotional support and a social atmosphere. Luis Morales-Navarro GSE ‘20 noted similar themes in explaining that ‘La Casa’ serves as a unifying house for both graduates and undergraduates to get involved on campus together and celebrate a shared identity, especially in polemical times such as these. ]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle=\"ParagraphStyle/p\"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/[No character style]\"><Content><![CDATA[Though much has changed since the founding of La Casa Latina, students’ appreciation of their cultures and passion for cultural awareness has not. Gilbert Casellas L’77, an invaluable asset in the founding years of La Casa Latina, shared some remarks from his involvement at La Casa Latina during his time at Penn, as well as some advice for current students and alumni. As an avid supporter of Penn, a Trustee Emeritus of the University, he encouraged alumni to show similar support, remarking that one is an alumnus far longer than a student. After graduating, alumni need to be vocal in encouraging current students to make their voices heard and give back to La Casa Latina after their time at Penn. To current students, Casellas emphasized the need to be active and to take part in what is offered. He stated that it is easy to sometimes feel isolated or as an “appendage of the University,” but that it is a great University because of the fact students, such as those who are involved in La Casa Latina, are at Penn. ]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle=\"ParagraphStyle/p\"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/[No character style]\"><Content><![CDATA[Similarly, Wendy De La Rosa W ‘11, the keynote speaker at the event, emphasized the necessity of students taking advantage of the resources at Penn and take ownership of one’s time and experience in college. Specifically, she shared how her realizations at Penn prompted her to become the person she is today. De La Rosa grew up in an apartment in the Bronx and upon coming to Penn, said she felt ashamed and overwhelmed by the amount of wealth and social status. She soon realized, however, that she was just as entitled to be there as anybody else and took advantage of her own power to make a difference on campus and get involved in organizations, such as La Casa Latina, to spread cultural awareness and celebrate her identity. ]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle=\"ParagraphStyle/p\"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/[No character style]\"><Content><![CDATA[Both Casellas and De La Rosa have gone on to have impressive careers. Casellas, after graduating law school, went on to practice law, served as the first Latino Chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under President Clinton, among many other extraordinary occupations, and now serves as the Chairman of OMNITRU. De La Rosa began a career in private equity at Goldman Sachs after she graduated from Wharton and soon after worked for Google. Now, she serves as the head and co-founder of Common Cents Lab. ]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange><ParagraphStyleRange AppliedParagraphStyle=\"ParagraphStyle/p\"><CharacterStyleRange AppliedCharacterStyle=\"CharacterStyle/[No character style]\"><Content><![CDATA[They both emphasized the fact that the power lies in the hands of the students. The fact that La Casa Latina is an established, vibrant, and progressive community on campus shows how far cultural inclusion has come, but a long path to a completely inclusive understanding of cultural identities remain. Students must use their voices, their votes, and the support of others to make change. Casellas and De La Rosa repeatedly commented on the importance of not staying silent, but being active and determined, leaving students, alumni, and faculty with an inspirational and motivational message to make change here at Penn. ]]></Content></CharacterStyleRange><Br/></ParagraphStyleRange></Story></Document>\\n',\n",
